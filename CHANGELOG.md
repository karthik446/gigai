# GigAI Changelog

This is the external, capability-focused history of GigAI. It describes what
an operator can do, not how the implementation works. The internal technical
history lives in [docs/development/changelog-internal.md](docs/development/changelog-internal.md).

Goal labels are milestone references, not package-version numbers. Goal order,
phase order, and release order are deliberately different; release notes must
not be inferred from a Goal number.

## Unreleased capability milestones

Backfill from the accepted Goal completion audits is intentionally tracked in
the internal changelog first. Entries added here must describe only a verified,
operator-visible capability and must link to the relevant release or evidence.

### Added

<!--
External entry shape:

#### GNN — Capability name

- What an operator can now do.
- Important user-visible boundary or limitation.

Do not include commit IDs, schema field names, test counts, or implementation
mechanics here. Those belong in the internal changelog.

## Released versions

### 0.1.4

- Adds the model-facilitated Gig builder for UAT: GigAI can guide an operator
  through a Gig definition, ask bounded adaptive follow-up questions, build a
  reviewable proposal, and require explicit approval before sealing it.
- This release is an alpha UAT candidate; configured live model families and
  real operator workflows remain subject to the G24/G26 UAT gate.

### 0.1.3

Release-specific capability notes will be reconciled from the G12 release
evidence and the verified capability inventory.

## Deferred and not advertised

This section records capability families that research or implementation
documents explicitly do not advertise as shipped. It prevents a feasibility
spike or roadmap item from becoming an external support claim by implication.
